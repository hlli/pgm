I used K-Means on the training set to get initialClassProb and initialPairProb.
Specifically, what I did was:
1. Combine posesData into a N by 30 matrix.
2. From rows corresponding to the first poseData, randomly choose a row as initial mu_1;
   From rows corresponding to the second poseData, randomly choose a row as initial mu_2;
   From rows corresponding to the third poseData, randomly choose a row as initial mu_3;
3. Run clustering until objective J converges

Repeat the step 2-3, choose the one that gives the smallest J
4. Get the corresponding class assignment;
5. Compute new mean.
6. Use this new mean as mean of multinomial normal, and calculate covariance.
7. Calculate ClassProb.
8. Calculate Pairprob.
